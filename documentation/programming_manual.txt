private macro
-------------

You will notice that c procedures often have the keyword "private" in
their signatures.  For example:

  private void make_listening_socket(int sockfd);

Be aware that "private" is a macro that simply adds the keyword
"static" if we are *not* in DEBUG mode.  This is because the static
keyword makes it impossible for our tests to access the procedure.
When debugging and running tests, we need total access. This is how
we can define which procedures are publicly callable and which are
mostly internal to that module.
