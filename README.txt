WEBSERVER
=========

this program will provide the functions necessary for a web
application.  It will be fast, and simple.  It won't necessarily be
easy.

1. server
2. database

Start your process by running the following command from the top
directory:

./set_environment_variables.

This will run a script that injects certain necessary variables into
the environment and will return you in a subshell.

// The following line sets the configuration when using Vim
// vim: ai:tw=70
