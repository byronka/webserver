TRACKER
=======

a text-based issue tracker.  Simple, but not always easy.

Instructions:

Each file should be named like this:
123-adding_a_login_page.txt

Where the first characters are the number of the issue, then there is
a dash, followed by a short description separated by underscores.

Each new issue should increment the id by 1.

use a header in each file like this:
Identifier: 123
Type: [BUG|FEATURE]
Status: [WAITING|ONGOING|CLOSED]

Then, include some description and have discussions.  Set header
values properly as issues progress.


// The following line sets the configuration when using Vim
// vim: ai:tw=70
